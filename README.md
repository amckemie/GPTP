### <b> About </b>

Built as our first hackathon project, Give a Penny, Take a Penny (GPTP) is a web app aimed at volunteers and non-profits. The goal was to create an application in which volunteers could search for available 'pennies,' otherwise known as volunteer opportunities, that had been posted by organizations. Once volunteers claimed 'pennies,' they would be responsible for committing to the volunteer requirements.
